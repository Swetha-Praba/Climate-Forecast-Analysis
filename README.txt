Introduction:
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of global temperature anomalies, focusing on seasonal variations using statistical and machine learning methods. The goal is to explore historical trends, detect outliers, and make predictions on future temperature anomalies using tools like Random Forest and ARIMA models.

Project Structure:
Data Preparation: Data loading, preprocessing, and feature engineering.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualization of temperature trends by season, detection of outliers.
Machine Learning Models: Regression and classification models for predicting temperature anomalies.
Time Series Analysis: ARIMA-based time series forecasting of temperature anomalies.

Methodology:
Data Preparation
Load data from global_temps.csv.
Create a mapping for seasonal abbreviations (DJF, MAM, JJA, SON) to full season names.
Reshape data using the melt() function for better visualization of seasonal trends.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualization of Seasonal Temperature Trends: A line plot showcasing seasonal trends across years, highlighting key temperature anomalies.
Outlier Detection: Outliers in the winter (DJF) temperatures identified using the IQR method.

Machine Learning Models:
Random Forest Regression: Predicts DJF temperature anomalies. Model performance is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² score.
Random Forest Classification: Classifies DJF temperature anomalies as above or below zero, evaluated using a confusion matrix and classification report.

Time Series Analysis:
ARIMA Model: An ARIMA model is fitted to the DJF temperature data to forecast future temperature anomalies.
Stationarity Check: The Augmented Dickey-Fuller test checks stationarity.
ACF & PACF: Used to determine the ARIMA model parameters.

Results:
Prediction Accuracy: Random Forest Regression performed well, with a scatter plot comparing actual vs. predicted values.
Classification Performance: The classifier accurately identified temperatures as above or below zero.
Forecasting: ARIMA model predictions aligned closely with actual data, with residual analysis suggesting good model fit.

Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the effective use of machine learning and time series models to analyze seasonal temperature anomalies. The combination of Random Forest models and ARIMA provides insights into both predictive and temporal trends, aiding in the understanding of climate change impacts.
